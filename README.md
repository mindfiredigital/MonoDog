# MonoDog

The dashboard will provide visual management and monitoring capabilities for packages in monorepos using pnpm, turbo, or Nx. It will be distributed as an npm package installable in any monorepo to auto-generate a web UI for package oversight.

## Why MonoDog

The Monorepo Dashboard addresses the complexity of managing many interconnected packages. It automates critical, error-prone tasks like semantic versioning and CI/CD, while providing immediate visual feedback on dependencies and package health. This optimization leads to faster development cycles and more reliable releases.
